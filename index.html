								<div class="projectContent" id = 'musicReviews' style="visibility: hidden; display: none;">
									<p> Music Reviews was a project involving the creation of a website through SpringMVC, using TDD, Java and the creation of a database with JPA.  The front was designed in Thymeleaf, using Flexbox and Grid in CSS while applying AJAX and Javascript.  The data for the views is accessed through a Spring Controller.  Musical artists are `organized by genre.  Users are able to create comments to be displayed on each musical artist's page. Artists were also organized by tags which users are able to create and delete from each artist's page using AJAX.  Each tag will direct user to all artists associated with that tag.</p>
									<p>This project was created in 3 weekend iterations as a project assignment for We Can Code IT.</p>
