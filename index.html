						<h1>About me</h1>
						<p>Junior software developer who believes the world is a village and we each have our roles to make a better life for all.  My passion, my role, is optimizing user experience. Software development and front-end design provide an outlet that allow me to create products which revolve around human intuition.   Currently enrolled at We Can Code IT!, a submersive 14-week program focusing on Java, TDD, web-design using grid, Flexbox, CSS, as well as Javascript. I obtained a bachelor's degree in Psychology focused in cognitive development, which helps provide insight on real-world user mentality.</p>

					<h2>Music Reviews</h2>
					<p> Music Reviews is a website created through SpringMVC with Thymeleaf.  The back was written in Java using TDD.  Musical artists were entered into a HashMap with different instance variables being accessed by the front HTML templates.  HTML templates were created for the index page and review pages.  Images and videos related to the band were embedded in each review.</p>
